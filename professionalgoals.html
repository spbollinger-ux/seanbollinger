        <p> One of my biggest career goals is to one day work in the video game industry in some capactiy. Video games have been a very big part of my life and I hope to one day work with some of the best and creative minds. 
            If I make it into the games industry I hope to be part of a AAA studio working on the biggest hits. A dream goal would be to work at either <b>Bungie</b> or <b>Rockstar</b>. Dreams that I hope to fulfill, but maybe a little reaching for the stars.
