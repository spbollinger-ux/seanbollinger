        <p> Sean Bollinger is an Undergraduate Student at the <a href ="https://www.wisc.edu/">Univerity of Wisconsin Madison </a>. He is majoring in <a href = "https://ischool.wisc.edu/">Information Science</a> with a Certificate (minor) in Computer Science.
            His interest in information science stems from user interaction with technology and is interested in designing interfaces or technology that helps make life easier for others.
            Other interests from here come from his love of video games, in which he hopes to one day be apart of. Currently, in his off time he is either participating in closed alpha tesing,
            beta testing, or working on his own game that he hopes to one day put out. Currently, he is working in the Unity Engine to help build a strong foundation of game development and designing.
