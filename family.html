                This is my family, father, mother, brother, and dog. My father is Mike Bollinger he is a VP of Finance Treasury and Risk Management for Eagle Creek Renewable Energy. 
                My Mother is Kelly Bollinger and she is a Pharmaceutical Tech for Centeral Wisconsin Pharmacy
                My Brother is Ryan Bollinger, fun fact we have the same birthday of September 20th, but were born 3 years apart. He works in factory work and also has his own Metalcore band called<i>I Rose From the Dead</i>
                Finally, there is my Saint Bernard dog, Duke. He is quite old now, but is still a big ball of love and fluff.
